### Django test instructions

*Two scripts in the scripts folder should be run*
    
    1. vm_django_activate sets up the virtual machine
    2. django_runserver runs manage.py runserver for testing

##### Errors
    - if you get something saying a character isn't recognized dos2unix "filename" usually works
    - unauthorized fixed by using chmod +x "filename" (should be set up already but just in case)

##### [Django Tutorial Source](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/)
    - This is what I used to set up the website, it's fairly simple.
